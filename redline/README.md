1. Correctly implemented:
	- Rendered a Google Map of the MBTA Red Line
	- Used a custom icon and icon shadow
	- Marked all stations and connected them with a polyline
	- Retrieved the user location with geolocation
	- Displays the user location with a marker and info box
	- Uses at least 1 CSS file
	- All files are stored in where private GitHub directory
	- Correctly determined the closest subway location to my location
	- Displays both Waldo and Carmen when found
	- Displays the distance between your location and Carmen and Waldo
	- When you click on a station, it displays the name of the station and the schedule

2. What didn't work well:
	- For some reason, the info window content does not appear on first click, you have
	to click again to display the dynamic information that AJAX gets, otherwise it just
	shows the string "loading..."

2. Collaborated with:
	- discussed Geolocation with Brett Fischler
	- talked about the polyline with Jay Wright
	- talked with Ann Bellinger

3. Hours spent:
	- 12 to 15 hours
