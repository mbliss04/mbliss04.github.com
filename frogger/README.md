1. Implemented correctly
    - The game loads immediately on the page.
    - Frogger moves when keys are pressed in the appropriate direction
    - Obstacles move across the screen at different velocities
    - Basic game scoring is implemented
    - Added sounds when frogger jumps, dies, and the game ends
    - Implemented a timer that ends the game when 30 seconds are up
    - Added level progression, speeds get faster after every five frogs that you jump home
    - Collision detection in both the water and on land
    - Player loses a life when he or she collides with an object

2. Wish I had done
    - I attempted to make the fly appear, however I was uncertain about how to extend the drawing past the interval
    - I also wish I had figured out how to make dead_frog.png to appear for a longer amount of time
    - Wish I had animated the turtles to go underwater

3. Approximate time spent
	- 20 hours

4. Worked with
	- Ann Bellinger
